## Improved SPARQL query rendering

The support for rendering a query algebra back into a SPARQL query string has been extended, now supporting BIND clauses correctly. In addition, an experimental alternative implementation has been added, which has improved support for path expression handling, among a few other things.

## Support for newline-delimited JSON-LD

We have added support for newline-delimited JSON-LD (inspired by [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) ). See [issue GH-2840](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues/2840) for details.

## RDF-star support updates

Various small improvements in RDF-star support have been done in order to align with the current [published draft](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/). In particular, the Turtle-star parser has been extended to support [annotation syntax](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-04-13.html#grammar-production-annotation).
